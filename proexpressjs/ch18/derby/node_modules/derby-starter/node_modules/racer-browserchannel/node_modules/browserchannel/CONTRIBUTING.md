# How to contribute to my project

**tldr;**

- Email me if I forget about you
- Write unit tests
- Make small pull requests
- If you need to recompile, commit those changes separately

I love pull requests, but I'm sometimes bad at replying to pull requests &
emails. Sorry - its not you, its me. Please email me regularly if replying is
important. (I'm me@josephg.com )

I get mad if I have to fix bugs in your code later.
As such, all new features introduced in pull requests MUST include tests
for any added functionality. Unless they fix an active bug, I will not accept a
pull request without tests. If they fix an active bug and writing tests sounds
hard, I might add tests myself.

Please break pull requests up into small atomic changes. Small changes are easy
to evaluate and merge. Large changes are much harder.

Please separate recompilation commits from actual code changes - recompiling
can generate giant diffs and make pull requests hard to read.
