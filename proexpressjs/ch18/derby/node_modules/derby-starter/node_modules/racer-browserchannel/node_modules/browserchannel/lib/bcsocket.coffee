# This is a little wrapper around browserchannels which exposes something thats compatible
# with the websocket API. It also supports automatic reconnecting, and some other goodies.
#
# You can use it just like websockets:
#
#     var socket = new BCSocket '/foo'
#     socket.onopen = ->
#       socket.send 'hi mum!'
#     socket.onmessage = (message) ->
#       console.log 'got message', message
# 
# ... etc. See here for specs:
# http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/
#
# I've also added:
#
# - You can reconnect a disconnected socket using .open().
# - .send() transparently works with JSON objects.
# - .sendMap() works as a lower level sending mechanism.
# - The second argument can be an options argument. Valid options:
#   - **appVersion**: Your application's protocol version. This is passed to the server-side
#     browserchannel code, in through your session handler as `session.appVersion`
#   - **prev**: The previous BCSocket object, if one exists. When the socket is established,
#     the previous bcsocket session will be disconnected as we reconnect.
#   - **reconnect**: Tell the socket to automatically reconnect when its been disconnected.
#   - **failFast**: Make the socket report errors immediately, rather than trying a few times
#     first.
#   - **crossDomainXhr**: Set to true to enable the cross-origin credential
#     flags in XHR requests. The server must send the
#     Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header and can't use wildcard access
#     control hostnames. This is needed if you're using host prefixes. See:
#       http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/#toc-withcredentials
#   - **extraParams**: Extra query parameters to be sent with requests. If
#     present, this should be a map of query parameter / value pairs. Note that
#     these parameters are resent with every request, so you might want to think
#     twice before putting a lot of stuff in here.
#   - **extraHeaders**: Extra headers to add to requests. Be advised that not
#     all headers are allowed by the XHR spec. Headers from NodeJS clients are
#     unrestricted.
