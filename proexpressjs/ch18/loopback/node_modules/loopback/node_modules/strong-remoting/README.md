# strong-remoting

Objects (and, therefore, data) in Node applications commonly need to be accessible by other Node processes, browsers, and even mobile clients.   Strong remoting:
 * Makes local functions remotable, exported over adapters
 * Supports multiple transports, including custom transports
 * Manages serialization to JSON and deserialization from JSON
 * Supports multiple client SDKs, including mobile clients

## Installation

```sh
$ npm install strong-remoting
```

## Documentation

Please see the [official StrongLoop documentation](http://docs.strongloop.com/display/NODE/Strong+Remoting).
